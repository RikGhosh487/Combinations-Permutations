# Combinations, Permutations, and Ordered Replacement Calculations
This program allows the client to perform simple counting algorithms for **statistics** courses.
The operations this program can perform include

- **Combinations**: a selection of items from a collection, such that the order of selection does not matter.
- **Permutations**: a way in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged.
- **Ordered Arrangement with Replacement**: a way in which items from a collection can be arranged with allowed repetition.

### How it works
This program has a very simple user interface
It follows the following algorithmic approach for finding solutions:
